# DigiText_backend / Shopify Backend Challenge

To reviewer: I build the entire backend / frontend of digitext.ca for my high school as a textbook management webapp. It is fully functional and currently operational at St. Paul's High School. I created a mock-database for anyone to fool around with:

www.digitext.ca
username: testUser
password: 2022SummerInternship

The webapp actually meets the requirements for many of the challenges but CSV data for all the relevant textbook data can be accessed by logging in --> textbook management --> EXPORT TO CSV.

To add / delete textbooks, click the "Add & Delete Textbooks" button on the menu.
Editing textbook can be done by clicking the "Textbook Management" button on the menu and searching for the relevant textbook to edit / delete.
A list of textbooks can be viewed by exporting the textbook data to CSV or by goign to "Textbook Management"

The webapp has many more features that you can play arround with! The most powerful feature of the webapp is the ability to assign textbooks to specific courses / teachers and this way each student will have a list of textbooks they need for the year. Specific students can be searched up on the "Student / Textbook Lookup" page with all the relevant info. There's many more features to be named but I'm sure you're busy so I'll be happy to discuss them if you're interested ;)
